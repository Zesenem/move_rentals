                Welcome to Move Rentals. These terms and conditions outline the rules and
                regulations for the use of our scooter rental services. By booking a scooter with

              <p>
                To rent a scooter from Move Rentals, all renters must meet the following criteria:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
                <li>
                  <strong>Minimum Age:</strong> Renters must be at least 18 years of age.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Driving License:</strong> A valid driving license is mandatory. For 50cc
                  scooters, a standard car license (Category B) or a moped license (Category AM) is
                  required. For 125cc scooters, a valid A1, A2, or A category motorcycle license is
                  required, or a Category B license held for more than 3 years, depending on local
                  regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Identification:</strong> A valid passport or national ID card is required
                  at the time of rental.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-steel mb-3">3. Security Deposit</h2>
              <p>
                A security deposit is required for each scooter rental and is taken as a
                pre-authorization on a valid credit card. The amount may vary depending on the
                scooter model. This deposit is fully refundable upon the safe and timely return of
                the scooter and all included equipment in their original condition, free from
                damage, loss, or any traffic-related fines.
              </p>{" "}
              <p>
                Even if a reduced security deposit package is purchased, the renter remains legally
                responsible for the full security deposit amount in the event of damage, loss, or
                violations.

                All rentals include basic third-party liability insurance as required by Portuguese
                law. This insurance covers damages to third parties but does NOT cover damage to the
                rented scooter, theft of the scooter, or personal injury to the rider. The renter is
                fully liable for the cost of any damages to or theft of the scooter up to the full
                value of the vehicle.
